# CRL-Mobile-First-Challenge

My solution to the Final Challenge for Conquering Responsive layouts.

CRL is a (free course)[https://courses.kevinpowell.co] by (Kevin Powell)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw]

Part of the challenge was to build it mobile first. This was the first time I'm really doing anything mobile first, so it took me a little longer.

However I learned a lot and will definately try to use the mobile-first approach in the future.
